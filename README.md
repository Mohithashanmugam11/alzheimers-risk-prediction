It integrates **gamified cognitive testing** and a **GenAI-powered personalized recommendation system** to assist patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.  

## 🚀 Features
- Alzheimer’s risk classification: **Healthy, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s**
- Ensemble models: **Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Stacking**
- **96% prediction accuracy** on Kaggle Alzheimer’s dataset
- **Gamified cognitive test module** for early detection
- **GenAI-powered recommendation system** generating personalized health guidance
- **Caregiver Mode** for patient profile management and secure result storage

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Pandas**
- **Flask** (web app), **SQLite** (database)
- **GenAI (LLM integration)** for recommendations
